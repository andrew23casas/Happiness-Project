# Happiness Project


### Description
The report uses Denmark's World Happiness score to explore culture and economy as influences of happiness. The World Happiness report of 2021 was used to present a comparison between countries' ladder scores and logged GDP's, versus the ladder scores among different cultures. The methods were conducted through a series of analyses including bootstrap confidence interval and Bayesian credible interval. This will demonstrate that the countries with a higher logged GDP have a higher mean ladder score.
